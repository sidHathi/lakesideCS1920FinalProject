# LakesideCS 19/20 FinalProject

This website is one of the first major CS projects I ever built. It uses php, html, css, and some JavaScript. You can view it at: http://1920.lakeside-cs.org/Hathi/finalproject/index.php. Please note that it only displays as intended on laptops and desktops, as I learned responsive design after completing it.
