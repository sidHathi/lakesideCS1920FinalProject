 E100 English 9 
--------------
This yearlong course explores literature dealing with broad themes of knowledge, responsibility, rebellion, and the power of individual choice. From the family feuds of Shakespeare to the historical Dominican Republic of Julia Alvarez, we encounter characters actively seeking knowledge, taking risks, and making crucial choices about how to lead their lives and challenge their societies. Exploring key literary works, in a range of genres from a diversity of viewpoints and cultural contexts, prompts us to examine our own personal experiences and reflect on different forms of knowledge — and their accompanying risks and responsibilities. We work intensively to hone reading, thinking, and writing skills in various modes (analytical, creative, etc.), and encourage self-expression and public speaking. Regular skill building in vocabulary and grammar will also develop these goals. Additional selected texts may include works by Sherman Alexie, Lorraine Hansberry, Marjane Satrapi, and J. D. Salinger. 
--------------
 E200 English 10 
--------------
This yearlong course explores themes and genres through diverse authors from around the world and across literary history. We examine such enduring themes as innocence and experience, conformity and rebellion, culture and identity, and love and hate. In addition, we study the specific characteristics and effects of different literary genres, principally fiction (novels and short fiction), drama, poetry, and literary nonfiction. By exploring the elements of literature through critical reading, students also hone their own expressive skills through a range of analytical, creative, personal, and persuasive writing assignments, as well as through public speaking, collaborative assignments, and creative projects. Texts include the anthology “Literature: The Human Experience,” “Interpreter of Maladies,” “The Dew Breaker,” a play by Shakespeare, and several additional novels, story collections, poems, and works of nonfiction.
--------------
 E301 American Cultural Studies I 
--------------
The first semester of American Cultural Studies explores what it means to be an American and how literature reflects a complex intersection of social, historical, economic, and cultural forces that shape the United States. We focus on key concepts that have helped form American identity, such as slavery, immigration, spirituality, war, economic selfdetermination, and discrimination. As we consider diverse American communities and experiences, we interrogate the meaning of “America” itself: What does it mean to claim an American identity, and how have American writers interpreted their cultural contexts? Our work together covers a core group of literary texts — fiction, poetry, drama, and literary nonfiction — and focuses on improving students’ skills in writing, reading, critical thinking, and speaking. Core texts usually include works by or selections from Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zora Neale Hurston, Julie Otsuka, and Moises Kaufman.
--------------
 E302 American Cultural Studies II 
--------------
This second-semester course offers an historical and genre-based selection of American literature and culture. Students draw directly on their concurrent studies in American history as they continue to learn how to read literary texts within their social, historical, and cultural contexts. Teachers also incorporate material from a variety of sources, such as visual art, music, and film, to enhance these explorations. Each individual teacher selects works from different eras, choosing from commonly agreed-upon lists covering these periods: pre-1900; 1900 to World War II; and World War II to the present day. Students also study at least one play and at least one major poet as well as vocabulary.
--------------
 E310 American Studies 
--------------
(Team-taught course, requiring simultaneous enrollment with  H310 - receives English and history credit) 17 This team-taught course offers an interdisciplinary approach to the themes, texts, and content of United States History ( H300) and American Cultural Studies I and II ( E301 and  E302). The essential belief that informs this course is that students’ understanding of, and appreciation for, American literature and history is enhanced by considering each in conversation with the other. We will explore issues of equality, justice, and power, and consider how different, and often conflicting, ideas about America have shaped this nation. Developing an understanding of various disciplinary modes of thought and analysis is expected, as is active participation in discussions, projects, and presentations. Writing assignments will include literary analysis, historical research, creative writing, and extensive journal work. Students will receive one grade that will be counted for both courses. (Note: This course will be capped at 22 students.)
--------------
 E401 Studies in Literature: Victorians 
--------------
What is Keira Knightley fighting against as she storms around the wind-swept countryside in “Pride and Prejudice”? Answer: 19th-century moral and social codes. And that’s why the Victorian era in Britain gives us so many classic novels: They are fascinating stories of people running up against outdated constraints, and they help us understand the transformation of socio-cultural values and the challenges to conformity in any era and in any setting. In this class, we will consider how the classic British Victorian novel plays out tensions between tradition and what will soon emerge as modernity. The Victorian novel perfectly dramatizes these contradictory discourses in the realms of class, power, gender, and sexual norms, and it illuminates how we have become the society we are today. Authors read may include Jane Austen, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Jean Rhys, Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, Oscar Wilde, H.G. Wells, and Joseph Conrad. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E405 Studies in Literature: Modernism 
--------------
The world — and human understanding of it — changed dramatically at the turn of the 20th century, undermining many fundamental assumptions that had existed for hundreds of years. People began to reappraise the most fundamental of questions: Who am I? What is my relationship to the natural world? What is my relationship to other human beings? What do I believe in? Where is the moral center? What is art? What is certain? Literature, like the visual arts, was marked by innovation and experimentation as writers sought new ways to address emerging uncertainties. In this course, we will explore how the major upheavals of the age manifested themselves in the poetry, prose, and drama of writers such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, Jean Rhys, Gwendolyn Brooks, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Samuel Beckett. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 18  E407 Studies in Literature: Postcolonialism: The Empire Strikes Back Darth Vader clenches his fist and declares, “Luke, you have only begun to discover your power!” Luke and his sister Leia, representing the Rebel Force in “Star Wars,” battle the Evil Emperor and his henchmen, and in the literary world, this rebellion takes the form of an international surge of amazing literature “striking back” at the former British colonial empire. In this course, students will explore the ways in which Postcolonial and Diaspora writers provide a provocative counterpoint to the literature of empire. Voices from new nations strike back, certainly, but they also create new and dynamic literary, artistic, and cultural aesthetics, deconstructing and deepening the classical literary canon in the process. Postcolonial and Diaspora literature examines the causes and consequences of colonization, resists colonial stereotypes, and defines cultural experience at the center rather than on the margins of new and emerging societies. Students will read literature from around the world — including from Africa, India, the Middle East, Australia, and Latin America — and will respond in a variety of expressive forms, including literary interpretation, creative writing, and personal explorations of identity. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E409 Studies in Literature: A Quest for Queer Literature 
--------------
Literature provides windows and mirrors for all of us as readers, revealing the lives of people, places, and times totally different from our own and reflecting our own identities and experiences with comforting familiarity. In this class, we will explore the dazzling diversity of identities and experiences of LGBTQ+ people from a variety of cultures, countries, and time periods. Although we will have some set primary and secondary texts, students will have the opportunity to seek out new works and genres of literature, art, and other cultural artifacts as we continue our quest together. As we read literature in the major genres – novels, drama, short fiction, literary nonfiction, and poetry – we will also learn helpful terminology, study some history and theory, and watch landmark LGBTQ+ films. Students will write for a variety of purposes, including personal narratives, poetry, fiction, reader response, and literary analysis, and they will conduct collaborative and independent research projects. Authors may include Sappho, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Djuna Barnes, Radclyffe Hall, James Baldwin, Nella Larsen, Christopher Isherwood, Edmund White, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Elizabeth Bishop, Adrienne Rich, Michelle Cliff, Jeanette Winterson, Michael Cunningham, Jeffrey Eugenides, Larry Kramer, Tony Kushner, Francesca Lia Block, David Levithan, Patrick Ness, Alison Bechdel, Andrea Gibson, Kay Ryan, and Janet Mock. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E411 Studies in Literature: The South 
--------------
Why are so many of America’s greatest writers from the South? What is it about the region itself that has produced such amazing literature in all genres? Historian Edward Ayers posits that “the very story of the South is a story of unresolved identity, unsettled and restless, unsure and defensive.” This course will let the South tell its own story, through the literature of some of its finest writers. From the Southern Gothic atmosphere of a Flannery O’Connor short story, the steamy tension of a Tennessee Williams play, and the colorful depiction of Yoknapatawpha County in a William Faulkner novel, we will come to a deeper appreciation of a region that is both haunting and beautiful. A study of culture — visual art, music, and food — will give us further sights and sounds of a region known for its hospitality and its swing. In short, this class offers the opportunity to learn about a place rich in tradition and culture, a place “where democracy and oppression, white and black, slavery and freedom, have warred” (Edward Ayers, “What We Talk about When We Talk about the South”). Possible authors include Eudora Welty, Bobbie Ann Mason, Carson McCullers, Richard Wright, Charles Chesnutt, Natasha Trethewey, Toni Cade Bambara, Flannery O’Connor, Tennessee Williams, and William Faulkner. 19 Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E413 Studies in Literature: Russian Literature 
--------------
Russia, one of the three powerhouses in the history of the European novel (along with England and France), has given us literary works that span the bustling streets of St. Petersburg, the icy expanses of Siberia, and the glittering courts of Imperial Russia. The class typically reads famous (and very long!) novels, such as Leo Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina” and Fyodor Dostoevsky’s “Crime and Punishment,” along with shorter fiction by Anton Chekhov, Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, Svetlana Alexievich, and poems by Anna Akhmatova. We also examine related aspects of Russian history, religion, and art. Student assignments include literary analysis, creative writing, regular journal writing and presentations. A word of advice: This course is appropriate for those who can commit to a rigorous reading schedule. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E415 Studies in Literature: African-American and Black Literature 
--------------
What does it mean to be black in America today? In this course, students will explore the possible answers to this question through reading, analyzing, writing about, and discussing contemporary literature and other media. The course will not only look at what place African-Americans take up but will also delve into how the essential question can be answered by those non-African blacks. Literature and media may include Touré, Colson Whitehead, Adam Mansbach, Paul Beatty, Taiye Selasi, Elizabeth Alexander, Dave Chappelle, “Black-ish,” and Zadie Smith, among others. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E417 Studies in Literature: Multiethnic Literature 
--------------
America is said to be a melting pot, a land of opportunity and freedom, a place where hard work is always rewarded and dreams come true … but for whom are these platitudes true? When and to what extent? We will examine different genres of literature (novels, short stories, essays, poetry, and drama) to investigate the ways in which different identities and different intersections of identities access, employ, challenge, disrupt, reorient, or expand what it means to be an American at specific junctures in history, including our current time. These identities include but are not limited to ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, class, religion, language, culture, age, and regional identity. Texts studied may include writers such as Kaveh Akbar, Franny Choi, Safia Elhillo, Layli Long Soldier, Celeste Ng, Claudia Rankine, Craig Santos Perez, Sam Sax, Anna Deavere Smith, Danez Smith, Justin Torres, and Natasha Trethewey. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E419 Studies in Literature: Chaos Theory 
--------------
Chaos principles are everywhere in nature, but what do they have to do with great literature? It turns out there are surprising parallels between certain key literary works and the upheavals in physics and mathematics of the 19th and 20th century. In an effort to bridge the gap between the humanities and the fields of mathematics and science, this class will read and interpret important and challenging books in several genres through the lens of particular chaos phenomena, such as sensitive dependence, scalable self-similarity, emergence, and fractals. We will delve into (among others) Jorge Luis Borge’s metaphysically dizzying speculations, Connie Willis’ novel about cultural fads, Italo Calvino’s microscrutinies of daily patterns, Margaret Atwood’s sobering account of reckless bioengineering, and Colson Whitehead’s crisp portraits of city life. In each case, we will examine how key chaos principles of dynamic systems are manifested, and we will look for illuminating patterns across disciplines. Students will write in a variety of modes, run class activities, and work on projects combing literary and mathematical thinking. 20 Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E421 Studies in Literature: Postmodernism
--------------
Many call our era “postmodern,” but what does that term really mean, especially when looking at literature and art? How should we respond to a novel written in fragments, to a series of poems that only use one vowel, to a play where nothing happens? What’s the difference between a modernist novel and a postmodernist film? Covering a broad range of different genres, this course will begin globally, with works by authors such as Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, and Samuel Beckett, to lay the groundwork for a close look at contemporary American writers such as Don DeLillo, Kay Ryan, Carol Shields, Geraldine Brooks, Gertrude Stein, Colson Whitehead, David Markson, and Charles Yu. Performance art, painting, cinema, music, graphic novels, and critical theory/philosophy will further enrich our wide-ranging discussions. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200
--------------
 E452 Literary Explorations: Art and Literature 
--------------
It’s hard to imagine “Alice in Wonderland,” “Winnie the Pooh,” “The Lord of the Rings,” or Dante’s “Inferno” without their famous illustrations and maps. Here and elsewhere, art isn’t just an accessory to literature: It is woven into it. In the 1941 classic about sharecroppers in the South, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” for instance, photography blends with text, and graphic novels (of course) seamlessly fuse text with art. Naturally, we can also find many novels, plays, and poems about artists and their art that are directly inspired by works of art, or that have themselves inspired new art forms. In this iteration of the course, we will study Dutch art of the Golden Age, and we will read works of modern literature inspired by Dutch painters such as Rembrandt van Rijn and Johannes Vermeer. Students will write analytical responses to both art viewed and literature read. Most significantly, they, like the authors under study, will write fictional and personal responses to artworks of their own choosing. Perhaps one day a novel begun in Art and Literature will sit alongside Donna Tartt’s “The Goldfinch,” a work inspired by Carel Fabritius’ painting of the same name
--------------
 E454 Literary Explorations: Diseases 
--------------
This course is a multifaceted study of global infectious diseases as well as other topics in global health. Using a variety of approaches, the course will examine the “big three” diseases — HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis — as well as other important pathogens. In addition to learning about the basic biology and epidemiology of these diseases, we will use illness as a lens through which to critically examine social issues such as poverty, gender, and race. Outside speakers, field trips, and service learning are essential parts of the course. Potential readings include: “The Ghost Map” by Steven Johnson, “Sizwe’s Test” by Johnny Steinberg, and the essays of Paul Farmer, Elizabeth Pisani, Laurie Garrett, and Sonia Shah, among others. Writing in this course involves students’ personal reflections on their understanding of the workings of disease in society, write-ups of epidemiological and case studies, journal entries, grant proposals, and descriptive narratives of the dynamics of illness. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 and S100 Note: This course is not yet approved by the NCAA. Students planning to play Division I or II collegiate sports should discuss with their college counselor the impact of this class on their NCAA eligibility. This course does not impact eligibility for students intending to play Division III. 21 
--------------
 E456 Literary Explorations: Cinema (Scene Analysis and Film Making) 
--------------
This class provides an overview of cinematic art. We begin by looking at the basic elements of a film, from the scene to the shot to the individual frame; doing so helps us better understand such things as the use of the camera’s angle and focal distance; the composition of lights and darks (cinematography); and the ordering and pacing of shots (editing). In the process, we’ll examine how stories variously get told; how genres shape our understanding; and how sound and special effects enrich our enjoyment. The course emphasizes a good deal of analytical and creative writing as well as group projects (students write, direct, shoot, and edit their own short films). Films studied may include those from the classic Hollywood era as well as acclaimed foreign films of today, from directors like Ingmar Bergman, John Ford, and Alfred Hitchcock, to Francis Ford Coppola, and Fernando Meirelles. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 Note: This course is not yet approved by the NCAA. Students planning to play Division I or II collegiate sports should discuss with their college counselor the impact of this class on their NCAA eligibility. This course does not impact eligibility for students intending to play Division III. 
--------------
 E458 Literary Explorations: Film (Narrative Analysis and Screenplay Writing) 
--------------
Film is a different animal than many other forms of media, and it takes a unique knowledge of three-act film structure, and screenwriting in particular, to understand why some films are blockbuster hits (“Lord of the Rings”), some become cult classics (“The Shawshank Redemption”), and some crash and burn (“The Time Traveler’s Wife”). Unlike most film studies courses, in this course, you will learn the foundation of narrative in Hollywood cinema, and you will use that information to build written pieces of your own original film idea: from logline to scripted scene to final pitch. You will watch a variety of films and read several screenplays to give you examples of the various ways that a narrative can be crafted while still adhering to three-act structure. Some of the films studies may include: “Memento,” “Do the Right Thing,” “The Hunger Games,” “Being John Malkovich,” and “Twenty Feet from Stardom.” Course Length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 Note: This course is not yet approved by the NCAA. Students planning to play Division I or II collegiate sports should discuss with their college counselor the impact of this class on their NCAA eligibility. This course does not impact eligibility for students intending to play Division III. 
--------------
 E462 Literary Explorations: Fiction Writing 
--------------
Do you miss writing stories? Ever read one and thought, “Wait, I want to do that again!” Well here’s your chance to get some experience. In this course, students will study the craft of fiction in the stories of a variety of such foundational short fiction writers as Anton Chekhov, James Joyce, Raymond Carver, Ernest Hemingway, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Katherine Mansfield, Flannery O'Connor, Toni Cade Bambara, and Junot Diaz. Great writers are, more often than not, enthusiastic readers whose fiction is inspired by the powerful prose of their literary predecessors and contemporaries. Although great writers write often and can sometimes produce in a single sitting a story surprising for its polish, success in writing more often requires revising drafts many times to achieve a story's greatest potential. Using the workshop model in which small groups and the whole class offer constructive critiques of peer manuscripts, students in this course will write and revise several drafts of their own original stories of widely varying lengths and types, leading to the creation of a portfolio of creative writing due at the end of the course. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 22 
--------------
 E464 Literary Explorations: Gender Studies 
--------------
How are gender norms created, regulated, and reinforced? Students in this course will use diverse texts — sociology, literature, film, popular media, guest speakers, and classroom discussion — to investigate these questions, and, in doing so, will also consider how gender overlaps and interacts with other aspects of identity, such as race, class, sexual orientation, religion, and nationality. In addition to leading discussions, giving speeches, and conducting interviews and research, students will write personal narratives, fiction, and poetry to process their findings. Though focused primarily on the United States, this class will examine the way people across the world “do gender,” leading us to a more nuanced understanding of the impact gender has both personally, in our day-to-day lives, and politically, in the global society in which we participate. In addition to the textbook “Gender through the Prism of Difference,” possible literary texts may include works by Michael Cunningham, Jeffrey Eugenides, David Henry Hwang, Alice Walker, Alison Bechdel, Margaret Atwood, and Virginia Woolf, as well as a range of short stories, poems, and films. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200 
--------------
 E466 Literary Explorations: Utopias/Dystopias 
--------------
What will society look like in the future? What can science fiction teach us about what we are now? What role do utopias and dystopias play in our collective consciousness? Robots, computers, artificial intelligence, cybernetics, bioengineering, and space exploration are not just booming fields of research: they are already woven into our lives. How might these and related areas impact us in the next decades and centuries? Should we let biological and social orders evolve by themselves, or should we rigorously manage their evolution? This course looks at classic works of speculative fiction and contemporary works of science fiction that deplore or explore the consequence of trying to unify human differences or transcend human limits. Works include well-known classics (e.g., by Thomas More, George Orwell, and Margaret Atwood), contemporary science fiction (e.g., Ursula Le Guin, Alastair Reynolds, Iain M. Banks, Octavia Butler, and Ken Liu), and film (e.g., “Moon,” “Gattaca,” “Her,” “Ex Machina,” and “The Truman Show”). Students write in many different modes, run all-class activities on relevant trends and concepts, and do various kinds of creative projects. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites:  E200

 E472 Literary Explorations: Quest 
--------------
The main objective of this three-part class (English, Outdoor Program, natural science) is to help students become better observers of themselves and of the surrounding world. English dimension: Students compose essays covering many topics from expositions to descriptions and narratives. This course emphasizes journal writing, with entries inspired by the trip to canyon country and readings by authors such as Elizabeth Gilbert, Annie Dillard, Edward Abbey, Craig Childs, Jon Krakauer, N. Scott Momaday, Ann Zwinger, Terry Tempest Williams, and David Williams. Outdoor 23 component: a three-week canoeing trip through the Labyrinth and Stillwater canyons of the Green River. This period includes spring break and the weeks before and after the break. Participants backpack, canoe, camp out every night, and are self-sufficient for our entire time on the river. Natural science portion: individual projects focusing on archaeological, biological, geological, and astronomical phenomena most easily studied in the field; this leads to student presentations during the trip. (Limit of 10 students. Cost: approximately $825, to be finalized after purchasing plane tickets). Financialaid students will be awarded aid toward the trip commensurate with their financial-aid status. Alternates: All students who sign up but are not selected automatically move to the alternate pool. After the drop/add period in the fall, a drawing is held to determine the order of the alternates (a separate drawing for boys and girls is held since gender balance is a course priority). Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: Seniors only Cost and notes: Approximately $750. Financial aid applies. Details are available from Associate Director of Admissions and Financial Aid Tearon Joseph (tearon.joseph@lakesideschool.org). Students’ teachers will support them when they return from the trip in making up what they missed, with an eye toward limiting the makeup work to what they truly need to successfully complete their courses.

 E474 Literary Explorations: Fantasy Literature 
--------------
How many hours have we each spent swallowed up in a great work of fantasy? Much of this feels like a delicious escape, but we must remember that stories of fantasy are rooted in a long tradition of storytelling, religious symbolism, social upheavals, and even military conflicts. In this course, we will read a limited number of epic fantasies, in whole or in part, to become better readers of this genre and to learn how to write our own stories. We will look carefully at craft, including story structure, world-building, naming conventions, invented languages, and the parameters of magic, and we will explore each individual work’s cultural references, including religious and historical allusions, as well as important socio-cultural issues. Our exploration of this genre will include a look at other genres and media, from religious texts to films, from folklore to graphic novels, and we will assess each work’s social impact and cultural significance. Texts may include “The Name of the Wind” by Patrick Rothfuss; “The Fifth Season” by N.K. Jemisin; “The Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien; “A Wizard of Earthsea,” by Ursula Le Guin.

 H100 World History: The Human Web 
--------------
How did the world get so interconnected? To what end has power been used by individuals, empires, and groups of people? This is a survey of the formative events, ideas, and conditions of the world from ancient history to the Enlightenment. Using project-based learning as our strategy, students will practice the skills necessary for successful historical inquiry: critical reading of a variety of sources; cogent analytical writing; participating successfully in class discussions; engaging in substantive research; and speaking persuasively. Themes emphasized include the evolution of belief systems, interactions between cultures and the environment, the rise of new political systems, inequity, and global economic integration. Projects include an ancient cultural heritage preservation project; a role-playing “diplomacy 26 challenge” project for early modern empires; and an Art in Context project focusing on the European Renaissance. The year culminates with a student-driven, comprehensive research project. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 H110 Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity 
--------------
This course studies the past from the origins of the universe to the present day and beyond. We will ask how the universe formed in the Big Bang, how stars and planets were created, how our earth changed, how life appeared on earth, and eventually how our own species evolved and spread around the world. Our studies will encompass the present-day impact of humans on the planet, and project the implications of these patterns into the future. Students will explore how both historians and scientists engage in the study of our world and our place within it. Using cutting-edge readings, as well as specially designed online modules, the class encourages students to utilize critical thinking and historical research as they explore what factors have shaped our past and inform our present. Historical and scientific data are interwoven throughout the course to provide a grand narrative of the development and growth of human civilization. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: None

 H200 The Modern World and You 
--------------
Why is our world the way it is? How did we get here, and where are we going? This class begins in the cauldron of political, economic, and social transformation after 1750 and runs to current events and issues. Students will learn how peoples around the world have caused and responded to an extraordinary rate of connection and change over the past 250 years, as the students develop the essential skills of close reading, analysis, research, collaboration, and communicating with clarity and conviction. Project-based learning informs all aspects of the course, including the Model U.N. position paper and simulation and a globalization project in the final quarter designed to inform service learning experiences. Motivated students who wish to take the World History AP exam are encouraged to consult with their teachers early in the year regarding additional preparation to ensure success. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites:  H100 or  H110 
--------------
 H210 The Modern World and You: GSL Peru 
--------------
Why is our world the way it is? How did we get here, and where are we going? This class incorporates the GSL experience into a yearlong history course. Classroom learning begins with an exploration of the cauldron of political, economic, and social transformation after 1750 and runs to current events and issues, with Peru’s experiences and Latin American trends used as touchstones. Examples of this include our focus on Peru’s independence movement, history of military coups, and relationship with human rights, and on how its economy has been changed by globalization. Students will learn how peoples around the world have caused and responded to an extraordinary rate of connection and change over the past 250 years. They will also develop the essential skills of close reading, analysis, research, collaboration, and communicating with clarity and conviction. Project-based learning informs all aspects of the course, including the Model U.N. position paper and simulation and a culminating globalization project in the final quarter. The GSL focus will include Seattle-based service learning during the fall semester, pre-trip orientation and preparation in the spring semester, and a final globalization project that will draw from students’ service and experiences in Peru. While on the trip, students will live in homestays, participate in significant service projects in the village, and visit sites of historical interest around Cusco, including Machu Picchu. Course length: Yearlong course 27 Prerequisites:  H100 or  H110 Time commitment and cost: Students in the course must participate in all the Seattle-based components of the class and the GSL experience. The trip to Peru will be three weeks, including spring break and the weeks before and after the break. An additional course fee equivalent to the cost of a GSL trip will apply to cover the costs of travel. Financial aid for travel is available. A student can count up to 20 hours of global service learning hours toward Lakeside’s graduation requirement of 80 hours of service. Students’ teachers will support them when they return from the trip in making up what they missed, with an eye toward limiting the makeup work to what they truly need to successfully complete their courses. More information on the trip and the class is available on the global programs webpage, https://lakesideblended.haikulearning.com/global/programs

 H300 United States History 
--------------
James Baldwin asserted that “the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.” This yearlong course provides students with a foundation for understanding the modern United States in all of its complexity. It also provides a foundation for active citizenship, exploring themes of power, the establishment of a republican form of government, and the intersection of politics and economics. The course is built around essential questions in the study of United States history, such as how foreign policy has changed over the past two centuries. Writing is an important feature of the offering and students will engage in both historical analysis and research projects. Motivated students who wish to take the United States AP exam are encouraged to consult their teacher early in the year regarding additional preparation to increase the chances of success.
--------------
 H401 Genocide in the Modern World 
--------------
In this course we will examine the Holocaust in Europe and genocide in Rwanda and Armenia. We will study the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, the systematic oppression and then annihilation of the Jewish people, and the legacy of the Holocaust in the modern world. With the Holocaust as background, we will examine the issue of genocide in other countries in the late 20th century. Using readings, film, novels, and personal testimonies, we will examine the nature of evil and goodness and prejudice and oppression, as well as the politics of exclusion. Throughout the course students will review the actions of perpetrators, bystanders, and leaders, in each case asking the question why was genocide possible. 28 Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 H405 Race Matters: Perspectives on the Black Experience 
--------------
“Race Matters” will review historical and contemporary responses to what is still a fundamental question in American life: how best to realize African-American equality. Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison once characterized the first 300 years of African-American history as the story of two eras: America’s “holocaust” and America’s “apartheid.” For her, these powerful analogies put American race relations into proper perspective. Obviously Morrison is not the only thinker to offer a provocative view. From “neo-nationalism” to “Talented 10th” to “hip-hop” philosophies, from old and young, the discourse is raucous! The class will draw from a range of scholars, leaders, and artists, from Toni Morrison to Stanley Crouch; from Spike Lee to Shelby Steele; from Zadie Smith and Ta-Nehisi Coates to Chimamanda Adichie and Barack Obama. The goal is for students to engage provocative points of view as they consider and deepen their own. Course Length: Semester course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 H409 Microeconomics 
--------------
Microeconomics is the study of the actions and interactions of optimizing individuals and firms. This course consists of a broad survey of the discipline, with attempts to establish fundamental concepts and introduce the subject matter of upper-level college courses. We will touch on, but not go in-depth into, economics, which looks at topics like unemployment and recessions. This course will introduce concepts that will help students better analyze and comprehend global events, past and current, and better understand the economic life in their own local community. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 H413 Social and Business Entrepreneurship 
--------------
Harvard Business School professor Howard Stevenson defined entrepreneurship as “the pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.” Whether the mission is Facebook’s “giving people the power to share” or Kiva’s “alleviating poverty,” entrepreneurship is a process through which individuals with big ideas implement lasting change in the world. Students will explore this field through guest speakers, case studies, lectures, and student presentations. Case studies, drawn from a variety of profit and nonprofit enterprises, will emphasize global opportunities and engagement. Lectures will focus on the theory and practice of implementing big ideas for social change. Students, working in teams, will develop and present a business plan for a venture that meets the theme of the course — i.e., a plan to implement a big idea of their own. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 H415 Understanding the Modern Middle East 
--------------
Why does such a large part of U.S. foreign policy, as well as media attention, focus upon the Middle East? This course is an opportunity for students to gain the cultural proficiency and the historical depth necessary to understand the complexities of this much maligned region. Students will engage in a series of critical discussions around media literacy and issues of gender and development in countries or regions as culturally and politically different as Iraq, Iran, Israel, and Palestine. Area-specific case studies will focus on some of the current issues facing the region and will also vary depending on the news of the day. Students will read broadly, across disciplines; in addition to the texts, they will engage with graphic novels, news sources, literature, and scholarly journal articles. Multiple guest speakers will add another rich layer to the course. This is a writing- and reading-intensive course. Assessments include simulations, as well as shorter writings and presentations. 29 Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: Open to juniors and seniors 
--------------
 H419 A History of Capitalism 
--------------
What is capitalism, exactly? In what ways has it succeeded and failed as an economic system? How has it contributed to the development and deterioration of the modern world? In this class we will examine the development of capitalist ideas through writings from, among others, Adam Smith, Eliot Spitzer, Thomas DiLorenzo, Ha-Joon Chang, Hernando de Soto, and Thomas Piketty. We will look closely at specific case studies that explore the way capitalism has affected society and business over time. The case studies might include: the feudalistic kingdom of Osnabrück, the British East India Tea Company, the Gambino crime family, a simulated small village in a developing country, and the financial crisis of 2008. As a final project, students will each create a case study, examining the effect of capitalist ideals on a business or government. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: Open to juniors and seniors

 H421 Mathematics of Democracy (cross-listed with Mathematics) 
--------------
What are elections for? Is there a simple, fair, consistent procedure for determining the outcome of an election? How does data impact the electoral process? What data can be believed and how do we know? What are other election systems used worldwide and what are their benefits and pitfalls? In this course students will draw from the disciplines of math, history, and political philosophy to better understand why democracies around the world work the way they do – and to consider whether some work better than others. The course will be organized around questions such as what makes a fair election, what the barriers are to fair election, and what the role of polling is in a democracy. The culmination of the course will be a final project in which students will draw from multiple strands of the course to pursue a question that is of interest to them (counts as either a History or Mathematics credit) Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: Open to juniors and seniors 
--------------
 H441 Advanced Research Seminar 
--------------
If you could investigate anything in history, what would you pick? This research-based course consists of a close study of a major piece of nonfiction writing followed by a deep-dive, independent research project from any era or region of a student’s choosing. Adam Hochschild’s account of Belgian atrocities in the Congo, “King Leopold’s Ghost,“ will be the focus of the first quarter: “The world we live in,” Hochschild writes, “its divisions and conflicts, its widening gap between rich and poor, its seemingly inexplicable outbursts of violence — is shaped far less by what we celebrate and mythologize than by the painful events we try to forget.” The historian seeks to investigate the past, remind us of things forgotten, and reframe history within the questions that occupy us in the present. Hochschild’s acclaimed book will serve as a case study of the construction of historical narrative and argument that will prepare students for their own research, the final products of which will be presented in a public forum. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: Open to seniors, or by permission of the department 30 SECOND SEMESTER ELECTIVES

 H452 Religious Studies: The World of Belief and Disbelief 
--------------
Is there life after death? Is there meaning to life? Have you ever met someone who can control where and when he or she will be reborn? Have you ever been inside a Muslim mosque or Buddhist monastery? Have you ever had the opportunity to ask a Hindu swami, Jewish rabbi, or Christian reverend about what truths their faiths have to offer you and humanity? This class will engage with these big questions and provide opportunities to visit sacred places and speak directly with visiting religious scholars while exploring five important world religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. We will examine these faiths as traditions of wisdom and look closely at their core beliefs and rituals. Along with the experiential facets to the course, students will read both primary and secondary material and write about, talk about, and express creatively their own personal journey as they shake hands with these traditions. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: Open to juniors and seniors 
--------------
 H456 Freedom, Crime, and the Law 
--------------
Added to the Constitution as a compromise, the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments have generated some of the most powerful and dynamic legal rulings in any society. In the early portion of the course, we examine those key amendments through analysis of landmark Supreme Court cases and in-class discussion and debate. We will dig into the way the Supreme Court has struggled to limit and expand criminal law through those amendments and how the rights of both accused criminals and victims have been protected (and not) over time. How far can police search when they come to your home? If you are stopped in your car? At the border? What has happened to Miranda — the man and the ruling? In the final part of the course, students will engage in a mock trial to generate thoughtful and earnest discussion on the justice system. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 H458 Macroeconomics 
--------------
Why does the economy experience booms and busts? Why is there unemployment? How do financial markets work? In this course, we explore questions about how the economy functions as a whole. Students will study the determinants of economic growth, the role of central banks and the monetary system, the economics of nations’ interactions, and the short-run fluctuations in economic output. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze current and past global economic developments, and will understand the current debates that continue to shape macroeconomic thought today. The course will help students prepare for the Advanced Placement Macroeconomics Exam, but the test is not a requirement. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 H462 Geopolitics and Game Theory: Analyzing Power (cross-listed with Mathematics) 
--------------
How can game theory be used to understand world events and decision-making? In this course students will apply a variety of mathematical tools and game theory models to analyze geopolitical decision-making. Students will study episodes of conflict and compromise, delving deep into source materials and devising analytical models with which to discern causes and consequences of the choices leaders make under uncertainty. Assignments and projects will address historical contexts and events, game theory principles, and the development of strategies for finding rational solutions to complicated real-world problems. Students will also gain the understanding of the history of game theory’s use in policymaking in situations like American War in Vietnam. Scenarios examined may include the formation of the United 31 Nations; the Bandung nonalignment conference of 1955; the Cuban Missile Crisis; the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); and the South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. (Counts as either a History or Mathematics credit) Course Length: Semester course Prerequisites: Open to juniors and seniors 
--------------
 H464 Sexuality and the Law: Making the Personal Political 
--------------
How did we go from a Defense of Marriage Act, defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman, to a Supreme Court case that overturned bans on gay marriage nationwide in under 20 years? What has it meant to be a man or a woman in this country? This course will begin with current case studies chosen by students and work backward to understand the history of how, when, and why gender has been constructed and reconstructed over the last 200 years. In addition, we will explore the emergence of women’s history as a field of study and the subsequent development of gender history. From the call for women’s rights at Seneca Falls to the growing movement for LGBTQ rights, it all has history and we will seek to understand how that past shapes present debates. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: Open to juniors and seniors 
--------------
 H468 Psychology 
--------------
Does stress make you sick? Is prejudice inevitable? When it comes to dating, do opposites attract? In this course, we will approach questions about human behavior using the tools of psychological science. We will explore key topics in biological, developmental, cognitive, and social psychology and evaluate recent research. Students will test their own hypotheses by designing and conducting an original experiment or survey. By the end of the course, students will be able to apply psychological principles to the world around them. Course length: Semester course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 H472 News and Media Literacy in the Digital Era
--------------
There’s A LOT of information out in the world today at the touch of our fingertips. Much of our news and the ways we interact with it comes from online sources and with this new form of media comes a host of exciting opportunities, but also problems. How do we get our news and how does this impact our understanding of the world? How do we know what sources to trust? What are techniques that are used to present and share information? Using current events, this course will explore these questions and issues to help students to continue to develop the critical skills of evaluating and analyzing sources and be more discerning consumers of media. Topics will include digital advertising; data visualization and presentation; pseudoscience and pseudohistory; and news on social media. Assignments will include following a developing news story and its presentation in various forms of media; journal entries on class questions and “Pictures of the Day”; and analytical responses to websites, advertisements, and more. Students will embark on a major project in a specific topic of their choosing as it relates to how information is shared and presented in the world today. Course Length: Semester course Prerequisites: Open to juniors and seniors 32

 H474 A Cultural History of Seattle
--------------
How much do you really know about the city where you live? Seattle has long been a city of communities, composed of different peoples with varying perspectives on the region, each contributing to the story of this place. Just as the demographics of this port city have shifted, so, too, has its character. Over time Seattle has undergone multiple reinventions, from boom town to company town to a center for technology. Seattle’s people have been variously interned, conquered, excluded, elevated, segregated, integrated, impoverished, emboldened, and enriched. Through it all, Seattle has grown more complex and layered, with the past sometimes honored and sometimes paved over. This class will expose students not only to the history of Seattle, but also to the practice of being local historians, wading into the world around them to better understand the place where we live. Additionally, students will further develop skills of close reading, learning from artifacts, historical analysis, content creation, and curation.
--------------
 L140 Chinese I 
--------------
This course is an introduction to standard Chinese (Mandarin Chinese). Using the text “Encounters,” students learn the Pinyin Romanization system and use acquired oral language skills in a variety of activities and games. While our focus is primarily on oral proficiency, students learn to read and write basic Chinese characters and to recognize these in context. At the end of this level, students will be at an ACTFL Beginning High level of oral proficiency, and will have acquired the following language skills: asking and answering questions, narrating events, describing likes and dislikes; making short oral presentations in Chinese and engaging in short reading and writing activities. These skills are employed within the framework of familiar contexts such as family, leisure activities, home, and school life. Films viewed include “The Road Home” and “Beijing Bicycle,” which give insight to Chinese family life and society in both rural and urban communities. Both films will be watched with English subtitles, occasionally focusing on the Chinese dialogue for comprehension. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: None 
--------------
 L240 Chinese II 
--------------
This course is a continuation of Chinese I and focuses on building students’ command of oral communicative structures in more sophisticated contexts. In addition, we expand students’ communicative abilities using “Encounters II,” the follow-up to our first-year text. In the class, we will work on building oral fluency with the goal of conducting the class entirely in Chinese by midyear. We build reading and grammar skills in a reading of “The Lady in the Painting,” a Chinese folk tale retold using 300 key characters. Students are expected to become more proficient in both handwritten as well as word-processed Chinese writing. Students will reach the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) “intermediate low” oral proficiency level at the end of the course. One major project is making a cooking video showing how a Chinese dish is done step by step with narration in Chinese. Films viewed include “Shower” and “Going to School with Dad on My Back.” Both movies will be viewed with English subtitles with content and cultural discussions conducted in mostly Chinese. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: C or better in Chinese I, successful completion of Chinese level C or D at Lakeside Middle School, or placement by the department. 34

 L340 Chinese III 
--------------
Our focus in Chinese III continues to be on increasing oral proficiency and fluency, along with both a review of major Chinese grammatical patterns and more intensified practice of Chinese characters to bring students to an intermediate level of proficiency. Students also begin to write expository essays in Chinese. Class discussion and presentations focus on comparing and contrasting the differences between Western and Eastern values on topics such as holidays and etiquette. At each curriculum unit, traditional Chinese culture and stories are introduced to enrich our knowledge, and they also serve as materials for discussion and role plays. Students will reach the intermediate mid level, as designated by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), by the end of the course. We view films that show the lives of ordinary Chinese both in cities and rural areas, such as “Together” and “Be There, or Be Square.” Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: C or better in Chinese II 
--------------
 L440 Chinese IV 
--------------
Students in this course will work to build functional expressive skills using the textbook “Encounters, Chinese Language and Culture, Book III” as well as with supplemental readings from news reports online and other publications. Thematic units focus on essential life skills such as shopping, cooking, seeing a doctor, opening a bank account, choosing a cellphone plan, etc. A selection of film clips that illustrate social changes in contemporary China will also be included. Our goal is to increase students’ range of vocabulary, to gradually approach more advanced listening and speaking skills, and to develop the skills and stamina to read longer essays. Students write short expository essays in Chinese and engage in presentations, and role play in class. Students will work solidly in the ACTFL “intermediate mid” level and approach or reach the ACTFL “intermediate high” level of oral proficiency upon completion of the course. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: B- or better in Chinese III 
--------------
 L540 Chinese V 
--------------
This course centers on learning about social issues in China using the text “Reading into a New China” with supplemental readings from news reports online and other publications. Thematic units focus on a wide range of issues current in China, including population issues and family planning policy, the educational system, environmental problems, love and marriage, and the divide between traditional and modern culture. Our goals are to increase students’ range of vocabulary and structures, to continue to progress toward advanced listening and speaking skills, and to develop the skills required to read more complex essays in formal language. Students are guided to write longer essays in different genres and engage in debates, presentations, and role play in class. They will also perform interviews of Chinese speakers at Lakeside and in the wider Seattle community and make documentaries based on their interviews and research. Over the course of the year, students will also view an entire Chinese TV serial drama, “Farewell Vancouver,” to increase their listening comprehension skills and to introduce students to the basic concerns of Chinese immigrants in North America. Students will approach or reach the ACTFL “advanced low” level of oral proficiency upon completion of the course. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: B- or better in Chinese III or Chinese IV 35

 L110 French I 
--------------
Introduction to French language and culture. This course is designed for students beginning a first foreign language as well as students who want to add another foreign language to their repertoire. Working with an e-textbook that includes significant opportunities for guided practice and authentic materials like a feature film and pop music., students learn skills and vocabulary needed to begin to communicate effectively in French and understand the culture of the French-speaking world. Oral proficiency is our primary goal, so teachers and students use only French in the classroom. Among the skills acquired are: asking and answering questions; describing and assessing people, places, and objects; narrating in present, future and past time; expressing opinions; and giving instructions to others. These functions are performed in familiar contexts such as talking about the family, home and school life, and leisure activities or going to a store, restaurant, party, etc. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: none 
--------------
 L210 French II 
--------------
Using materials developed by the instructor, students continue to build on the functions described in French I with a greater level of fluency, adding variety of structure and vocabulary, and covering a wider range of topics. Added functions are: talking about the future; hypothesizing; and expressing opinions, emotions, doubt, and necessity. Classes are conducted entirely in French. Students read and discuss short authentic pieces such as poems, stories, and news items and view a feature-length film to broaden their understanding of francophone cultures. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: C or better in French I, successful completion of French level C or D at Lakeside Middle School, or placement by the department.

 L310 French III 
--------------
What does it mean to come of age in the French-speaking world? This course builds on skills taught in French II and emphasizes greater oral and written proficiency in French as students explore what it is like to grow up and come of age in France and other countries in the francophone world. Students expand their vocabulary by engaging in conversations, including role playing and problem-solving. Though much of their writing is creative, students will also explore various aspects of French and francophone culture, from literature to music, from climate change to pop culture, from politics to film, and will produce both oral and written reports. Students view at least one French film (a recent example is “La Famille Bélier”) and read several works of fiction, which in previous years have included ”Le Petit Prince”; “Le temps des miracles,” a novel about refugees fleeing to France; and the coming-of-age stories “Persepolis” and “M Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran.” Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: C or better in French II or equivalent 
--------------
 L410 French IV 
--------------
The two main goals of this class are for students to improve their accuracy and style in speaking and writing and to increase their awareness of cultural and other current issues in the Francophone world. The course utilizes a selection of materials such as literature, art, music, film, journalism, and audio-and videotaped language segments that present topics pertinent to the social, political, and historical realities of the francophone world. Students use their French in a variety of activities, which include class discussions, small group conversations, monologues, interviews, role plays, oral reports, 36 written essays, and multimedia presentations. An example of a special project was to interview a native speaker about their childhood experiences in a francophone country. Examples of readings from recent years include excerpts from Driss Chraïbi’s novel “Civilisation, ma mère” (Morocco), Faïza Guène’s novel “Kiffe kiffe demain” (about life in the Parisian suburbs); Edmond Rostand’s “Cyrano de Bergerac” (France), and Jean-Paul Sartre’s play “Huis clos” (France). This course prepares students to take the AP French Language Exam. Course length: Yearlong course Prerequisites: B- or better in French III 
--------------
 L510 French V 
--------------
The culmination of our French program, this course challenges students to broaden their cultural competency and to communicate with more accuracy, at a more refined level, and with a greater lexical repertoire. Using a variety of authentic materials such as plays, short stories, poetry, films, and articles from the current press or the Internet, the class explores topics of historical and cultural interest. Student productions include leading a discussion, acting out a scene, relating the literature to cultural elements of its era or our own, and creating a multimedia presentation.
